Hi, I’m **Varsha Yadav**, a passionate software tester and Lead SDET with over **12 years of experience** in software testing, automation, and release management.  

Throughout my journey, I’ve had the privilege of designing **AI-driven test automation frameworks**, optimizing release processes, and mentoring high-performing QA teams. I thrive on leveraging **cutting-edge technologies** to solve complex problems, from generating synthetic test data to prioritizing test execution with AI insights.  

This website is my way of sharing my expertise with others, helping testers and tech enthusiasts learn and grow. It’s also a space where I showcase my work, share ideas, and explore the ever-evolving world of software quality and automation.  

I’m a lifelong learner, always keen to embrace new technologies and challenges. Whether it’s mastering a new automation tool, implementing smarter testing strategies, or exploring AI and ML applications in QA, I enjoy turning innovation into impact.  

If you’re curious about **test automation, quality strategy, or tech leadership**, you’re in the right place. I hope my experiences inspire and guide you in your journey.  

When I’m not testing software or building automation frameworks, I enjoy exploring new tech trends, solving challenging problems, and sharing knowledge with the community.
